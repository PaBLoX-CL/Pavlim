This is a basic set of plugins and stuff, it's based mainly on [gavim2](https://github.com/gaveen/gavim2/), [Janus](https://github.com/carlhuda/janus) and some lost vimrc by [Jeffrey Way](http://net.tutsplus.com/articles/general/top-10-pitfalls-when-switching-to-vim/ "Top 10 pitfalls when switching to vim").

Right now is it under heavy development, so don't expect somethingfunctional.
